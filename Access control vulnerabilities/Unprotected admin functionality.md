## Solution steps

- Visit `robots.txt` by appending `/robots.txt` to the url. Notice that the Disallow line discloses the path to the admin panel.
- `robots.txt` is a plain text file placed in the root directory of a website (like `example.com/robots.txt`) that tells web crawlers (like Googlebot) which parts of the site they are allowed or not allowed to access.
- In the URL bar, replace `/robots.txt` with `/administrator-panel` to load the admin panel.
- Delete user named Carlos.
