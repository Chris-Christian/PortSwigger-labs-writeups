## Solution steps

- Open Burp suite and set-up proxy.
- Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
- Try replacing `stockApi` directly with our own URL, like: `stockApi=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`
- Click "next product" and observe that when we test tampering with the path parameter, we see that it gets inserted into a `Location:` header in the serverâ€™s response.
- Create a URL that exploits the open redirection vulnerability, and redirects to the admin interface, and feed this into the `stockApi` parameter on the stock checker: `/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`
- Observe that the stock checker follows the redirection and shows you the admin page.
- Amend the path to delete the target user: `/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`
