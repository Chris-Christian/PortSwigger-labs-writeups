## Solution steps

- Inject a standard XSS payload, such as: `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`
- Observe that this payload gets blocked.
- Open Burp Suite and set up proxy (keep the intercept off).
- Enter a random string, such as: `hello`
- From Http history, send the `GET` `/?search=hello` to intruder.
- In the request template, replace the value of the search term with: `<>`
- Place the cursor between the angle brackets and click Add `ยง` to create a payload position.
- Visit the XSS cheat sheet by portswigger and click Copy tags to clipboard.
- In Burp Intruder, in the Payloads side panel, click Paste to paste the list of tags into the payloads list. Start attack.
- Observe that all payloads caused a `400` response, except for the ones using the `<svg>`, `<animatetransform>`, `<title>`, and `<image>` tags, which received a `200` response.
- Go back to the Intruder tab and replace your search term with: `<svg><animatetransform%20=1>`
- Place the cursor before the = character and click Add ยง to create a payload position.
- Visit the XSS cheat sheet and click Copy events to clipboard.
- In Burp Intruder, in the Payloads side panel, click Clear to remove the previous payloads. Then click Paste to paste the list of attributes into the payloads list. Start attack.
- When the attack is finished, review the results. Note that all payloads caused a `400` response, except for the `onbegin` payload, which caused a `200` response.
- Working Payload: `<svg><animateTransform attributeName="transform" onbegin="alert(1)"/>`
  - `<svg>`: root container (allowed)
  - `<animateTransform>`: allowed tag
  - `attributeName="transform"`: required attribute to make the tag valid
  - `onbegin="alert(1)"`: executes JS when animation begins
