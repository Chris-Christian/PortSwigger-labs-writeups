## Solution steps

- Open any blog post and write a comment to trigger an alert with random name and email.
- Notice that you can trigger an alert easily with this kind of payload: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- But in this lab we have to steal victim's credentials, then use it to log in to the victim's account.

- This Lab has 2 solutions, one using Burp Collaborator and another without using Burp Collaborator. I will explain the steps without using burp collaborator as I don't have the premium version. But I will paste the another solution at the bottom from their official solution for your and my convenience :)

### Without using Burp Collaborator

- This solution is considered less subtle because this will make the victim post their credentials within a blog comment and every user visiting the page will be able to see it.
