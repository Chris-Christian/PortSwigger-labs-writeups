## Solution steps

- Open Burp Suite and set up proxy (Keep the intercept off).
- Log in to your account using the given credentials and notice the option for uploading an avatar image.
- Upload an arbitrary image, then return to your account page. Notice that a preview of your avatar is now displayed on the page.
- In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to /files/avatars/. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
- On your system, create a file called exploit.php, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example: <?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
- Upload this script as your avatar. It uploaded successfully.
- In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE> request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with exploit.php and send the request.
- Observe that instead of executing the script and returning the output, the server has just returned the contents of the PHP file as plain text.
- In Burp's proxy history, find the POST /my-account/avatar request that was used to submit the file upload and send it to Burp Repeater.
- In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the POST /my-account/avatar request and find the part of the request body that relates to your PHP file.
- In the Content-Disposition header, change the filename to include a directory traversal sequence: Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="../exploit.php"
- Send the request.
- The response says "The file avatars/exploit.php has been uploaded."
- This suggests that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence from the file name.
- Obfuscate the directory traversal sequence by URL encoding the forward slash (/) character using Ctrl+u, resulting in: filename="..%2fexploit.php"
- Send the request and observe that the message now says The file avatars/../exploit.php has been uploaded.
- This indicates that the file name is being URL decoded by the server.
- In the browser, go back to your account page.
- In Burp's proxy history, find the GET /files/avatars/..%2fexploit.php request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response.
- This indicates that the file was uploaded to a higher directory in the filesystem hierarchy (/files), and subsequently executed by the server. Note that this means you can also request this file using GET /files/exploit.php.
- Submit the secret to solve the lab.
